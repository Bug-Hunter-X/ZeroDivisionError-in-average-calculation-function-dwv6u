This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError. The `calculate_average` function attempts to calculate the average of a list of numbers.  However, it does not handle the case of an empty list, leading to a division by zero error. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle this edge case by returning 0 or raising a more appropriate exception when the input list is empty.
